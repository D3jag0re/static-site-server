# static-site-server

# simple-monitoring

This is based off the DevOps Roadmap Project [Statis Site Server](https://roadmap.sh/projects/static-site-server)

Setup a basic linux server and configure it to serve a static site. 

This is number 6 of [21 DevOps Projects](https://roadmap.sh/devops/projects) as per roadmap.sh

## Description From Site 

The goal of this project is to help you understand the basics of setting up a web server using a basic static site served using Nginx. You will also learn how to use rsync to deploy your changes to the server.

## Requirements

Here are the requirements for this project:

- [X] Register and setup a remote linux server on any provider e.g. a simple droplet on DigitalOcean which gives you $200 in free credits with the link. Alternatively, use AWS or any other provider.
- [ ] Make sure that you can connect to your server using SSH.
- [ ] Install and configure nginx to serve a static site.
- [ ] Create a simple webpage with basic HTML, CSS and image files.
- [ ] Use rsync to update a remote server with a local static site.
- [ ] If you have a domain name, point it to your server and serve your static site from there. Alternatively, set up your nginx server to serve the static site from the serverâ€™s IP address.

You can write a script deploy.sh which when you run will use rsync to sync your static site to the server.

Once you have completed the project, you should have a basic understanding of how to setup a web server using a basic static site served using Nginx. You should also have a basic understanding of how to use rsync to deploy your changes to the server.
## To Run 

- Setup the following repository secrets:
    - DO_TOKEN : Digital Ocean access token
    - DO_SPACES_SECRET_KEY : Digital Ocean spaces secret key (for Terraform state file)
    - DO_SPACES_ACCESS_KEY : Digital Ocean spaces access key (for Terraform state file)
    - DO_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY : Keypair to be used for VM 
    - DO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY : Keypair to be used for VM

- Run workflow: This will build and install everything, as well as run 1 cpu stress test 


## Notes 

- Going to use terraform to build droplet 
- Going to use GitHub Actions to do all the initial setup
